                <p>Hello! I’m Muhammad Shaheer, a passionate <span class="animated-text">Web developer</span> and <span class="animated-text">UI/UX designer</span> to creating seamless digital experiences. With a strong foundation in both front-end development and user-centered design, I blend technical skills with an eye for aesthetics to bring ideas to life.</p>

                   <p> My journey began with a curiosity for how things work, leading me to study <span class="animated-text">Software Engineering</span>. Over the years, I've honed my skills in <span class="animated-text">HTML</span>,<span class="animated-text">CSS</span>,<span class="animated-text"> JavaScript</span>, and various design tools like <span class="animated-text">Figma</span> and <span class="animated-text">Adobe XD</span>. I believe that great design goes beyond visuals—it's about understanding user needs and crafting intuitive interfaces.
                    
                   I thrive on collaboration and love working with teams to solve complex problems. Whether it's developing a responsive website or designing an engaging app, I approach each project with a user-first mindset, ensuring that functionality and beauty go hand in hand.
                    
                    When I’m not coding or designing, you can find me playing online games and cricket mostly, always looking for inspiration in everyday life.</p>
                    
                   <p> Let’s connect and create something amazing together!</p>

                    As a Web Developer Intern at Ray Media Group, I worked on front-end and back-end development for several web applications over the course of 8-9 months.

                       Melody Sounds & production is all about bringing your events to life with top-notch sound, lightening and production services based in USA. 
                       There mission and vision is to ensure you that your event is unforgettable. As it was a an event based website so my main focus was to create a design that attract the clients eyes and bring their attention to the services provided by this firm. 
                       The main problem faced in this project was the high quality pictures and color schemes but later on the color scheme was approved by the clients and it took me less than 4 days to complete this design.

                       Melody Sounds & production is all about bringing your events to life with top-notch sound, lightening and production services based in USA. 
                       There mission and vision is to ensure you that your event is unforgettable. As it was a an event based website so my main focus was to create a design that attract the clients eyes and bring their attention to the services provided by this firm. 
                       The main problem faced in this project was the high quality pictures and color schemes but later on the color scheme was approved by the clients and it took me less than 4 days to complete this design.
